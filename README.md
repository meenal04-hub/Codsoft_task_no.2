Credit Card Fraud Detection
Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial sector, costing billions of dollars annually. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. The goal is to assist financial institutions in identifying potentially fraudulent activities in real-time, ensuring the security of customer transactions while minimizing false positives.

The dataset used for this project contains anonymized transaction data, including features such as transaction amounts, time of transaction, and engineered numerical features. Fraudulent transactions are typically rare, making this a highly imbalanced classification problem. The project demonstrates the application of data science techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning models to address this challenge effectively.

About the Model
The model leverages supervised learning algorithms to predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. Below is an overview of the process:

1. Dataset
The dataset used is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset. It contains:
284,807 transactions (of which ~0.17% are fraudulent).
30 features: 28 anonymized numerical features (V1-V28), transaction amount, and time.

2. Data Preprocessing
Data Balancing: Since fraud cases are rare, techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or undersampling were used to balance the dataset.
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler was applied to normalize features like "Amount" and "Time."
Train-Test Split: The data was split into training and testing sets (80%-20%).

3. Model Selection
Several machine learning models were evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression: A simple baseline model for binary classification.
Random Forest Classifier: A robust ensemble method to handle imbalanced data.
XGBoost: A gradient-boosting algorithm known for its high performance.
Neural Networks: Applied for advanced feature extraction and fraud detection.

4. Evaluation Metrics
Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, traditional accuracy metrics are insufficient. Instead, the following metrics were used:

Precision and Recall: To measure the model's ability to correctly classify frauds.
F1 Score: A balance between precision and recall.
ROC-AUC: To evaluate the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.

5. Results
The best-performing model achieved:

Precision: 0.9956
Recall: 0.7184
F1 Score: 0.5565

6. Deployment
The final model is integrated into a simple pipeline for real-time fraud detection. Future steps include:

Deployment using Flask/FastAPI for API-based predictions.
Integration with a database to handle real-world transactions.
